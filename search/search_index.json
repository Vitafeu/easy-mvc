If not, please follow the Composer installation instructions.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#creating-a-new-project","title":"Creating a new project","text":"<p>When your development environment is ready, then you can create a new project. There are several ways to do that, as you can see below.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>At the moment, the project (therefore the package) is not stable yet (that's why we specified <code>dev-main</code>). Do not use it in production ! If you encounter any problem, please open a GitHub issue.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#using-composer","title":"Using Composer","text":"<p>If you wanna use Composer to create the project, you can simply create a new project with the Composer <code>create-project</code> command. This command will automatically clone the Easy MVC repository and install all the dependencies. Here's an example :</p> <pre><code>composer create-project vitafeu/easy-mvc:dev-main AwesomeProject\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>AwesomeProject</code> with the name of your choice, just navigate to your project directory and you'll be good to go :</p> <pre><code>cd AwesomeProject\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting-started/#cloning-the-repository","title":"Cloning the repository","text":"<p>If you don't want to use Composer, you can clone the Easy MVC repository :</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Vitafeu/easy-mvc.git AwesomeProject\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>AwesomeProject</code> with the name of your choice, then navigate to your project directory and install the Composer dependencies :</p> <pre><code>cd AwesomeProject\ncomposer install\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"getting-started/#configuring-the-project","title":"Configuring the project","text":"<p>After creating the project, you'll need to configure it. Navigate to your project directory and copy the <code>.env.example</code> file to <code>.env</code> (you can also create a new .env file if you want) :</p> <pre><code>cp .env.example .env\n</code></pre> <p>This file will be used to define the environment variables, such as the database connection. You can edit it to suit your needs.</p> <p>That's all you need to do to get started !</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#testing-the-project","title":"Testing the project","text":"<p>You can now test if your projet is working as expected. Assuming that you are in the project directory, you can run the following command :</p> <pre><code>php easy serve\n</code></pre> <p>Info</p> <p>Don't worry if you don't know what this command's about, we'll cover it later. For now, just remember that it will start the development server.</p> <p>This command will start the development server in the <code>public</code> directory (your project's entry point). You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to test your project.</p> <p>If you see the message \"Welcome from Easy MVC !\", then your project is working as expected ! </p> <p>Failure</p> <p>If you see anything else, please check you've correctly followed the instructions, or search for any hints in the console output.</p>"}]}
