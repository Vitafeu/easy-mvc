# Welcome to Easy MVC !

Easy MVC is a small and lightweight PHP framework designed to simplify web development following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It provides a clean and organized structure for building web applications with ease. Easy MVC is packed with features such as routing, database integration, and way more to come. 

!!! note
    Remember, this project (and this documentation) is still under development. Features will be added as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience !

This framework is designed to be a light, easy-to-use, and flexible framework that can be easily integrated into any project, but doesn't include any of the advanced features that Laravel and Symfony have. If you want to build a simple web app and don't need any of the advanced features, Easy MVC is the perfect choice for you !

!!! info
    If you plan on using this framework to build a very robust and complete web application, maybe you should consider using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) or [Symfony](https://symfony.com) instead.
